# Coursera Data Science Projects


## Hello, welcome to Adrian's data science coursework. Here I will put all my coding projects assigned from coursera, which will mostly be written in R.

###Programs
####pollutantmean.R, complete.R, and corr.R are designed to work with data in the specdata folder. Feel free to download the folder and specify the directory = "specdata/" when using the functions in corr, complete and pollutantmean.
